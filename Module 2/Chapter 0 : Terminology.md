# Git Terminology

When we come across something new for the first time, we often get confused with the language being used to carry out operations. To get familiar with the terms used while working with git and GitHub, go through this sheet. 

Let us have a look at basics terminologies used in git. To master the tool, you would need to familiarize yourself with the terms involved. 

Let’s get going!

**Version Control System:** A version control system is a system designed to keep track of the source code over time. Git is an example of a version control system. Github is a platform which utilizes git. 

**Repository:** Repository can be termed as a container for things like documents and source code. Official documentation defined repository as, <code>"A <strong>repository</strong> is like a folder for your project. Your project's <strong>repository</strong> contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history." </code>A repository is the single storage place for all the project work.

**Commit:**

Commit Refers to data snapshots. Upon every commit, a snapshot of the look of the file is stored. In general terms, changes made to file inside a repository are made using commits. Commits are kind of logs for changes made in the repository. “commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.

**Branch:**

A branch is when a new line of development is created that diverges from the main line of development. By default, the straight line of development is called “Master”.

**Forking a repository:** Forking a repository means to create a copy of the repository. Once a repository has been forked, the repository can be viewed under one’s own account.

**Cloning a repository:** Copying the repository to the local machine is called cloning a repository.

**Starring a repository:** People generally star some repositories so that the can trace the work being done on those repositories.

**Working Directory:**

Working Directory refers to the directory where there are updates made to the code and this generally refers to the working folder on the local machine. 

**Staging Area/Staging Index:**

A file in the git directory that stores information about what will go into the next commit. The staging area is like a prep table where it will take the next commit. Files on the staging index are poised to be added to the repository

**SHA:**

SHA refers to a unique identification number for each commit. SHA is a 40 character string command composed of characters( 0 to 9) and (a-f) and is calculated based on contents of files in it. SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm
